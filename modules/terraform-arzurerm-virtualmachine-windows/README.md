# terraform-azurerm-storageaccount
Terraform module to create an Windows Virtual Machine

# Prerequisites
This Application assumes that you already have a virtual net provisioned inside of the landing zone, so you are going to need the name of the vnet and subnet that you will be deploying too, and the resource group and location that the v-net resides in

## Description
An Azure storage account contains all of Azure Storage data objects: blobs, file shares, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that's accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. 

This module will create a Storage account with blob containers & file shares only as per the requirements of the Siemens App Transformation showcase. (Queues & tables cannot be created with this module at this time)

## Module Example Use
```hcl
module "virtual-machine" {
    source = "../../modules/terraform-arzurerm-virtualmachine-windows"

    # variables for the rsg and vnet/subnet
    rsg_loc = "germanywestcentral"
    rsg_name = "cu1-lnd1-d-rsg-vms"
    vnet_name    = "cu1-lnd1-d-gewc-vnet-spoke"
    subnet_name  = "cu1-lnd1-d-gewc-snet-spoke-back"


    # variables for the nic
    nic_name = "vmnic01"

    # variables for the vm
    vm_name = "winvm001"
    vm_size = "Standard_B2ms"
    admin_username = "AzureUser"
    admin_password = "P@ssW0rd"

    # variables for the image used by the vm
    publisher = "MicrosoftWindowsServer"
    offer = "WindowsServer"
    sku = "2019-Datacenter"
    image_version = "latest"

    # variables for the os disk used by the vm
    caching  = "ReadWrite"
    storage_account_type = "Standard_LRS"

    # set the tags
    tags = {
    "AtosManaged" = "true"
    "AtosBackup" = "Bronze"
  }

```

# DCS Tags
| Name | Type | Description 
| --- | --- | --- 
| `AtosManaged` | `bool` | Weather or not this Virtual Machine is an Atos Managed instance (defaults to false)
| `AtosBackup` | `string` | Indicates a VM must included for backup in the Azure Recovery Services Vault that has been created in the same subscription and region as the VM. The tag value defines which backup schedule the VM must be assigned to.
| `AtosPatching` | `string` | When the AtosPatching tag is set, and the tag value is set to the name of a valid patch schedule, the VM will be added to Azure Update Management and the VM will be patched as defined in the selected update management schedule.
